### Opening (Home Page)

TEG-Blue is a visual framework for understanding emotional patterns — built on the principle that emotions are biological information, not irrational noise.

Most of us were never taught to read our own emotions clearly. We were told to calm down, toughen up, or let it go. We learned to override what we felt instead of understanding what it meant. TEG-Blue changes that.

By mapping how our nervous system organizes around safety and threat, TEG-Blue gives you practical tools to name what's happening, regain your footing, and choose your next step.

## Two Ways In

**→ Emotional Tools** — 16 visual instruments for spotting patterns in yourself and others. No theory required. Just look and recognize.

**→ Circuit Board** — Your personal coordinates. What society assigned you, what childhood shaped, where you land now, and where patterns lead.

## Going Deeper (Optional)

Want to understand where it all comes from?

**The Inner Compass** shows where your nervous system is pointing (Connection → Protection → Control → Domination).

**The Map** explains why — 12 levels tracing how patterns form, escalate, and heal.

Start with what's practical. The depth is there when you're ready.
