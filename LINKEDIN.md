**TEG-Blue — The Emotional Gradient Blueprint**

Emotions are biological information — data about safety and threat, not irrational impulses to be managed or overcome.

**The core insight:** State determines capacity. What someone can perceive, feel, think, and do depends on their nervous system regulatory state — not their character or intelligence.

**The dual question:** Where am I? Where are they? Knowing both tells you what's relationally possible.

**The mobility principle:** Health is mobility, not position. Everyone moves through all four modes. Getting stuck is the problem, not being in Protection.

**The framework:**
• Four-Mode Gradient: Connection → Protection → Control → Domination
• 12 Frameworks explaining how patterns form, scale, and heal
• Practical tools for pattern recognition

**The science:** TEG-Blue synthesizes 139+ established theories (Porges, Bowlby, van der Kolk, Damasio). We didn't invent the building blocks — we propose the connections between them. The individual theories are validated. The connections are our hypothesis, open for verification.

**The testable claim:** The key variable predicting relational outcomes is not current state, but capacity to return to Connection when challenged — measurable through complexity markers in natural language.

**For practitioners:** Shared language across modalities. Tools that distinguish protection from manipulation.

**For researchers:** Testable claims, open questions, published validation studies.
