# TEG-Blue

**The Emotional Gradient Blueprint** — An integrative architecture for emotional clarity, connecting established research from neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and trauma studies into a unified system for understanding emotional experience.

## The Core Insight

> **State determines capacity** — what someone can perceive, feel, think, and do depends on their nervous system regulatory state, not their character or intelligence.

## The Reframe

Emotions are biological information — data about safety and threat, not irrational impulses to be managed or overcome.

This changes everything. Instead of asking "why am I so emotional?" we ask "what is my nervous system detecting?" This is neuroception — the body's below-conscious scanning for safety and threat.

TEG-Blue maps how emotional states move from nervous system regulation into social systems and healing pathways. The framework operates through:

- **Four-Mode Gradient**: Connection → Protection → Control → Domination
- **12 Frameworks**: Scientific architecture explaining why modes exist and how patterns form
- **Emotional Tools**: Practical instruments for pattern recognition
- **Validation Research**: Computational analysis of 10,000+ natural conflict narratives

## Two Sites, One Framework

TEG-Blue exists across two complementary sites:

| Site | Repository | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **[teg-blue.com](https://teg-blue.com)** | [teg-blue-site-com](https://github.com/emotionalblueprint/teg-blue-site-com) | Interactive tools and application for everyday users and practitioners |
| **[teg-blue.org](https://teg-blue.org)** | [teg-blue-site-org](https://github.com/emotionalblueprint/teg-blue-site-org) | Open science platform for researchers and academics |

### teg-blue.com — Application

The application site offers:
- **Emotional Tools** — Visual thermometers and gradient scales for self-assessment
- **Inner Compass** — The Four-Mode Gradient for orientation ("Where am I?")
- **The Map** — 12 levels explaining emotional patterns ("Why am I here?")
- **Circuit Board** — Interactive model that calculates your personal coordinates: how system friction (societal factors) and childhood conditioning shape your current position and escalation pathway

Two content tiers: **Explorer** (accessible, personal) and **Deep Diver** (professional, clinical).

### teg-blue.org — Open Science

The research platform hosts:
- **Publications** — Validation studies and working papers
- **Theoretical Foundations** — 139+ source theories organized by framework
- **Open Research Questions** — Priority areas for independent validation
- **Collaboration Opportunities** — How researchers can contribute

All content designed to be readable by both humans and AI systems.

## What Is Original

The 12 frameworks draw on 139+ established theories from Porges, Bowlby, van der Kolk, Bourdieu, Damasio, and many others. Every source theory is credited.

**The originality is not in the individual theories — it is in the connections between them.**

These research traditions developed independently, within separate disciplines, often without reference to each other. TEG-Blue proposes specific cross-disciplinary connections:

| Connection | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| Nervous system regulation → moral perception | Regulatory state shapes which moral judgments a person makes |
| Attachment patterns → social stratification | Same protective mechanisms that organize individual identity also organize social hierarchies |
| Self-protection → domination as continuous gradient | From legitimate self-protection through control to domination — with identifiable transition markers |
| Linguistic complexity → regulatory capacity | Specific linguistic markers indicate capacity to return to Connection |

## The Core Testable Claim

> The key variable that predicts relational and behavioral outcomes is not a person's current regulatory state, but their **capacity to return to Connection when challenged.**

This capacity is measurable. It shows up in language. It appears to be predicted by **complexity markers** — signs of self-awareness, perspective-taking, and emotional differentiation.

## The Dual Question

TEG-Blue answers two questions:
- **Where am I?** — What's my current nervous system state?
- **Where are they?** — What state is the other person in?

Knowing both tells you what's relationally possible. You can't have a Connection conversation with someone in Control. You can't reason with someone in Protection. The map shows you what to expect — and what's actually available.

## The Mobility Principle

> **Health is mobility, not position.**

Everyone moves through all four modes. Being in Protection isn't the problem — getting stuck there is. A well-regulated system returns to Connection when the threat passes. A dysregulated system stays locked in protection even when safety is available.

The key variable isn't where someone is right now. It's whether they can move.
