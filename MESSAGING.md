# TEG-Blue Messaging Hierarchy

Single source of truth for how we describe TEG-Blue across all contexts. When in doubt, use these exact phrases to ensure consistency.

---

## The Core Identity

**What TEG-Blue IS:**
- An integrative architecture connecting established research into a unified system
- A framework for understanding emotional experience through nervous system regulation
- A mapping system with practical tools
- A hypothesis about how established theories connect — open for scientific verification

**What TEG-Blue is NOT:**
- A therapy or treatment method
- A diagnostic system
- A personality typology

### The Reframe

**Old view:** Emotions are irrational impulses to be managed, controlled, or overcome.

**TEG-Blue view:** Emotions are biological information — data about safety and threat from a system that evolved to keep us alive.

This reframe is foundational. Once emotions become data, we can read them. We can map them. We can understand what they're telling us without being hijacked by them.

### The "1 + 2 = 3" Principle

TEG-Blue doesn't invent the building blocks. Polyvagal Theory, Attachment Theory, Affective Neuroscience, Trauma Research — these are established. They are the "1" and the "2."

**What TEG-Blue proposes is the "3" — specific connections between them:**
- That nervous system regulation shapes moral perception
- That attachment patterns and social stratification follow parallel structures
- That protection and domination exist on a continuous gradient with identifiable transitions
- That linguistic complexity markers indicate regulatory capacity

The individual theories are validated. The connections are our hypothesis. We need the scientific community to help us see if "3" makes sense.

This is why we say: **"The originality is not in the individual theories — it is in the connections between them."**

---

## The Problem We Address

### One-Liner
> Emotional misunderstanding fuels conflict, manipulation, and harm — and we can't tell the difference between someone protecting themselves and someone trying to control others.

### The Full Problem (use for landing pages, grant applications, talks)

**The problem is ambiguity.**

Emotional misunderstanding fuels conflict, manipulation, and harm across individuals, organizations, and systems. Many existing models struggle to distinguish between:
- **Trauma-driven protection** — defensive patterns that developed for survival
- **Intentional emotional manipulation** — strategic control of others

Both can look similar on the surface. Yet they require very different responses.

As digital platforms and AI systems increasingly mediate communication, decision-making, and power, this ambiguity is amplified rather than reduced. Emotional dynamics scale faster than our ability to interpret them, leading to breakdowns that are personal, organizational, and systemic.

**What's missing is legibility.**

The science exists. Decades of research across neuroscience, attachment theory, trauma studies, and social psychology have produced detailed understanding of how emotions work. But this knowledge is fragmented across disciplines, published in specialist language, inaccessible to the people who need it most.

We don't have a shared language for emotional patterns. We don't have tools that help ordinary people — or AI systems — distinguish protection from manipulation. We don't have a map that connects individual nervous system states to the social structures they produce.

### Problem Statements by Audience

| Audience | Problem Statement |
|----------|-------------------|
| **General** | We misread each other's emotions constantly — and it costs us relationships, opportunities, and peace of mind. |
| **Practitioners** | Existing frameworks don't give us a shared language across modalities, or tools to distinguish protective patterns from harmful ones. |
| **Organizations** | Emotional dynamics in teams and systems are invisible until they become crises — and even then, we lack diagnostic tools. |
| **Researchers** | The science of emotion is fragmented across disciplines that rarely talk to each other, limiting both theory and application. |
| **AI/Tech** | AI systems trained on human communication inherit our emotional ambiguities and amplify them at scale. |

---

## The Solution: What TEG-Blue Does

### One-Liner
> TEG-Blue makes emotional behavior legible.

### The Core Idea

TEG-Blue is a system for making emotional behavior legible. It treats emotions not as noise or subjective chaos, but as **structured biological and relational signals** that organize behavior in predictable ways.

The system maps:
- How nervous systems respond to safety and threat
- How those responses shape identity and behavior
- How individual patterns scale into social systems
- How repair becomes possible when conditions change

Rather than labeling people or diagnosing traits, TEG-Blue focuses on **state-dependent patterns** and the **conditions that produce them**.

### Solution Statements by Audience

| Audience | Solution Statement |
|----------|-------------------|
| **General** | TEG-Blue gives you a map for understanding emotional patterns — yours and others' — so you know what you're seeing and how to respond. |
| **Practitioners** | TEG-Blue provides a unified framework and shared language that bridges modalities, with tools to distinguish protection from manipulation. |
| **Organizations** | TEG-Blue maps how individual patterns become team dynamics, giving you diagnostic tools before patterns become crises. |
| **Researchers** | TEG-Blue synthesizes fragmented research into an integrative architecture with testable claims and open questions. |
| **AI/Tech** | TEG-Blue offers structured representation of emotional dynamics that could inform more emotionally intelligent AI systems. |

---

## The Dual Lens

TEG-Blue answers two questions simultaneously:

| Question | Focus | Component |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Where am I?** | Self-orientation | Inner Compass |
| **Where are they?** | Other-orientation | Inner Compass |
| **Why am I here?** | Self-understanding | The Map |
| **Why are they there?** | Other-understanding | The Map |

**The outcome:** Knowing both positions tells you what's relationally possible.

- Both in Connection → engage, collaborate, repair
- One in Protection → wait, offer safety cues, don't push
- One in Control/Domination → protect yourself, set boundaries, limit exposure

This dual-lens approach is what makes TEG-Blue relational, not just personal. It's not enough to know yourself. You need to read others to know what's actually available between you.

---

## The Mobility Principle

> **Health is mobility, not position.**

Everyone moves through all four modes. Protection isn't pathology — it's a survival response. The problem is when someone gets stuck.

A well-regulated nervous system:
- Shifts into Protection when threat appears
- Returns to Connection when threat passes
- Moves fluidly based on actual conditions

A dysregulated system:
- Stays locked in Protection even when safety is present
- Can't access Connection even when it's available
- Treats everything as threat

**The key variable isn't where someone is. It's whether they can move.**

This is the core testable claim: capacity to return to Connection predicts relational outcomes better than current state.

## Level 3: Elevator Pitch (2-3 sentences)

Use for: Introduction conversations, About page summaries, conference networking

### For Everyone
> TEG-Blue maps how emotional states move from your nervous system into your relationships and beyond. It shows where you are on a gradient from Connection to Domination — and why that matters for everything from personal relationships to social systems. Built on established neuroscience and psychology, not invented from scratch.

### For Practitioners
> TEG-Blue is a unified framework that connects nervous system regulation to relational patterns and social dynamics. It provides practical tools for assessment and a shared language across therapeutic modalities. The system integrates 139+ established theories into a coherent architecture with two tiers: accessible for clients, professional-depth for clinicians.

### For Researchers
> TEG-Blue proposes an integrative architecture connecting established theories across neuroscience, psychology, and sociology. The core testable claim: the key variable predicting relational outcomes is not current regulatory state, but capacity to return to Connection when challenged. Initial validation shows this capacity correlates with measurable linguistic complexity markers.

## Level 4: Short Description (1 paragraph)

Use for: Website About sections, press kit, grant summaries

### Standard Version
TEG-Blue (The Emotional Gradient Blueprint) is an integrative architecture that connects established research from neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and trauma studies into a unified system for understanding emotional experience. The framework maps nervous system regulatory states along a gradient — Connection, Protection, Control, Domination — and explains how individual patterns scale into relationships, families, and social structures. TEG-Blue doesn't invent new theories; it synthesizes existing ones, with every source credited. The result is a complete map from how patterns form, to why they persist, to what makes change possible.

### Emphasis on Science
TEG-Blue synthesizes 139+ established theories from researchers including Porges (Polyvagal Theory), Bowlby (Attachment), van der Kolk (Trauma), and Damasio (Emotion Science) into an integrative architecture. The framework's core claim — that capacity to return to Connection predicts relational outcomes better than current state — has been tested through computational analysis of 10,000+ natural conflict narratives, with results showing 78% higher complexity markers in those who de-escalate versus those who escalate.

### Emphasis on Practical Application
TEG-Blue provides practical tools for understanding emotional patterns — your own and others'. The Four-Mode Gradient shows where your nervous system is right now (Connection, Protection, Control, or Domination). The 12 Map Levels explain why you're there and what shapes the pattern. The Emotional Tools help you recognize signals and make better decisions. Everything is grounded in established science, presented accessibly.

## Audience-Specific Messaging

### For Someone Struggling Emotionally
**Lead with:** Recognition and validation
**Avoid:** Technical language, claims about "fixing" things

> TEG-Blue helps you understand what's happening in your emotional life — not to judge it, but to see it clearly. The framework shows how your nervous system responds to safety and threat, and why that shapes everything from your mood to your relationships. It's not about being broken. It's about understanding how the system works.

### For Therapists & Coaches
**Lead with:** Integration across modalities, practical application
**Avoid:** Claiming to replace existing approaches

> TEG-Blue offers a shared language that bridges therapeutic modalities. Whether you work with attachment, somatic approaches, or cognitive frameworks, the Four-Mode Gradient provides a common reference point. The 12 Frameworks give depth for case conceptualization, while the Emotional Tools translate directly to client work. Two content tiers: Explorer for clients, Deep Diver for professional application.

### For Organizational Consultants
**Lead with:** Systems perspective, scaling individual to collective
**Avoid:** Oversimplifying organizational dynamics

> TEG-Blue maps how individual nervous system patterns scale into team dynamics and organizational culture. The same gradient that describes personal regulation — Connection through Domination — appears in how groups function under pressure. This provides a diagnostic lens for identifying where systems are stuck and what conditions enable healthier patterns.

### For Academic Researchers
**Lead with:** Testable claims, methodology, open questions
**Avoid:** Overstating validation status

> TEG-Blue proposes specific cross-disciplinary connections generating testable hypotheses that no single source discipline could produce alone. The framework has undergone initial computational validation (n=10,000+ narratives) with results published on Zenodo. Priority research questions include: standardization of complexity markers as psychometric instruments, cross-cultural replication, and causal mechanism studies. The theoretical mapping is a working hypothesis inviting scholarly verification.

- "nervous system states" (not "personality types")
- "patterns" (not "disorders" or "problems")
- "neuroception" (Porges' term for below-conscious threat detection)
- "emotions as data" or "biological information" (not "irrational impulses")
- "mobility" and "capacity to return" (not fixed states)

### Never Use:
- "TEG-Blue proves..."
- "The only framework that..."
- "Cures" or "fixes"
- "Diagnosis" (we don't diagnose)
- "Type" as in personality type
- Claims about specific therapeutic outcomes

## Hero Combinations: Problem + Solution

Use these ready-made pairs for landing pages, pitch decks, and introductions.

### For General Audience (Website Home)
**Problem:** We misread each other's emotions constantly — confusing protection with manipulation, fear with hostility, shutdown with indifference.

**Solution:** TEG-Blue makes emotional behavior legible. A map built on neuroscience that shows where you are, where others are, and what that means for what's possible between you.

### For Practitioners
**Problem:** Existing frameworks give us pieces — attachment, trauma, somatic, cognitive — but no shared language, and no clear way to distinguish protective patterns from harmful ones.

**Solution:** TEG-Blue integrates 139+ established theories into a unified architecture with two tiers: accessible for clients, professional-depth for clinicians. One framework, shared language, practical tools.

### For Researchers
**Problem:** The science of emotion is fragmented across disciplines that rarely talk to each other. Cross-disciplinary connections remain invisible.

**Solution:** TEG-Blue proposes specific connections — nervous system regulation to moral perception, attachment patterns to social stratification — generating testable hypotheses no single discipline could produce alone.

### For Organizations
**Problem:** Emotional dynamics in teams are invisible until they become crises. By then, patterns are entrenched and options are limited.

**Solution:** TEG-Blue maps how individual regulation patterns scale into team dynamics, giving diagnostic language for early intervention and systemic repair.

### For AI/Tech Contexts
**Problem:** AI systems trained on human communication inherit our emotional ambiguities and amplify them at scale — unable to distinguish protection from manipulation.

**Solution:** TEG-Blue offers a structured representation of emotional dynamics that could inform more emotionally intelligent AI systems — legibility not just for humans, but for the systems we build.

### For Accessible Introduction
**Problem:** We've been told emotions are irrational — something to manage, control, or overcome. But what if they're actually information?

**Solution:** TEG-Blue treats emotions as biological data about safety and threat. A map that shows where you are, where others are, and what that means for what's possible between you.

## Site-Specific Voice

TEG-Blue uses two voices for two audiences:

### teg-blue.com — Application Voice

**Lead with:** Tools, recognition, practical application
**Tone:** Warm, personal, accessible
**Entry:** "Most of us were never taught..."
**Audience:** Anyone struggling, curious, or wanting to understand themselves and others

**Tagline:** Tools to understand yourself and the people around you.

**Opening:**
> TEG-Blue is a visual framework for understanding emotional patterns — built on the principle that emotions are biological information, not irrational noise.
>
> Most of us were never taught to read our own emotions clearly. We were told to calm down, toughen up, or let it go. We learned to override what we felt instead of understanding what it meant. TEG-Blue changes that.

**Two ways in:**
- **Emotional Tools** — 16 visual instruments for spotting patterns. No theory required.
- **Circuit Board** — Your personal coordinates. What society assigned, what childhood shaped.

**Going deeper (optional):**
- **Inner Compass** — Where your nervous system is pointing
- **The Map** — 12 levels explaining why patterns form

**Key shift:** Start with what's practical. The depth is there when you're ready.

### teg-blue.org — Research Voice

**Lead with:** Architecture, science, testable claims
**Tone:** Professional, precise, intellectually honest
**Entry:** "State determines capacity..."
**Audience:** Practitioners, researchers, academics

**Tagline:** An integrative architecture for emotional clarity.

**Opening:**
> TEG-Blue is an integrative architecture connecting established research from neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and trauma studies into a unified system.
>
> State determines capacity — what someone can perceive, feel, think, and do depends on their nervous system regulatory state, not their character or intelligence.

**Core elements:**
- **The testable claim** — Capacity to return to Connection predicts outcomes
- **The 1 + 2 = 3 principle** — Building blocks are established; connections are hypothesis
- **139+ source theories** — All credited, open for verification

**Key shift:** Lead with the science. The practical application is at .com.
